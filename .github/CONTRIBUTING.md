# Contributing to Password Generator

First off, **thanks for taking the time to contribute**!

The following is a set of guidelines for Password Generator contributors. These are mostly guidelines, not rules.

Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by this Code of Conduct. Please report any unacceptable behavior to [hi.plexify@null.net](mailto:hi.plexify@null.net).

## I do not want to read the whole Code, I just have a question!

[Create a blank issue](https://github.com/Cyanic76/password-generator/issues/new?title=Question) and fill the description with your question.

## What should I know before getting started?

### Password Generator

This is an open-source project. Previously [located here](https://cyanic.glitch.me/passwordgen), it is now open source and can be fully trusted by users.

### Decisions

When Cyanic makes a significant decision in how the project is maintained and what is supported/unsupported, it'll be documented in the README.md file. *This may be changed in the future!*

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

This little section will guide you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps the maintainer and community understand your report.

When creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out [the BUG REPORT template](https://github.com/Cyanic76/password-generator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=state%3A+waiting&template=bug_report.md&title=). The information it asks helps resolving issues faster.

**Before submitting a Bug Report**

- **[Search through Issues and Pull requests](https://github.com/Cyanic76/password-generator/issues?q=)** to see if your bug is already in a report. If you find out that it has already been reported or a fix has been proposed, you don't need to create a report.

- **Read the whole** Contributing guidelines.

- View [this table] to see if your OS/Browser is still supported. If it is not, do not open a bug report.

**How do I submit a bug report?**

We track bug reports in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Cyanic76/password-generator/issues). Explain the problem & include additional details to help other users reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear & descriptive title**.
- **Describe the EXACT steps which reproduce the problem**. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but also explain **how** you did it.
- If an error shows up, **copy-paste it into your report**. It helps knowing the cause of the problem and providing a fix.
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and point out where's the problem.
- **Explain the expected behavior**.
- If you can not copy-paste what you see, **provide screenshots** which show you following the steps you described.
- **Provide browser information**.

### Proposing new features

This little section will guide you through requesting a new feature. Following these guidelines helps the maintainer and community understand your suggestion & maybe find related suggestions.

**Before submitting a Feature Request**

- **[Search through Issues](https://github.com/Cyanic76/password-generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22ctn%3A+enhancement%22) and [Pull requests](https://github.com/Cyanic76/password-generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22pr%3A+feature%22+)** and see if your request is already open. If you find out that it is, you don't need to open another issue.

- View [this table] to see if your OS/Browser is still supported. If it is not, do not open a feature request.

### How do I submit a feature request

We track bug reports in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Cyanic76/password-generator/issues).

- **Use a clear & descriptive title**.
- **Provide a step-by-step description** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific example to demonstrate the steps**.
- **Describe the current behavior & the one you expected**.
- **Use screenshots** to show what part of Batch System the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why it would be useful** to most users.
- **Provide browser information**! Something may work on latest Chrome but not on an old Firefox version (e.g. 59).
